# Gradution--Project-
***Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning***

This project centers on analyzing the customer behavior of an online retail store. The objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis. Data cleaning and transformation will also be carried out. The programming language used in the analysis is Python, and the data set is loaded from a csv file. The analysis is done in Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle and Google Colab.


For this project, a dataset from a retail store containing over sixty thousand transactions was used. The EDA was carried out by checking for missing data and duplicates, and data cleaning was done by dropping missing values and excluding negative values. The RFM analysis was then performed, where recency, frequency, and monetary were calculated using specific formulas. The K-Means algorithm was employed to cluster the customers. The Davies-Bouldin score, the silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz score were used to evaluate the performance of K-Means algorithm. The data was then plotted, and normalization was carried out using the logarithm function. The plot showed the data distribution before and after normalization.


Tools used for development and testing include Streamlit, SilhouetteVisualizer and Matplotlib, which are all data visualization tools used in the analysis. Validations were carried out by checking the data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. The K-Means algorithm was also used as a data segmentation tool. Achievements include understanding customer behavior through data analysis, making recommendations to improve customer experience, and improving revenue by understanding customer buying patterns.


In conclusion, the analysis provided a clear understanding of customer behavior in the online retail store and insights to make strategic decisions. The RFM analysis was crucial in understanding customer segmentation, and the normalization made it possible to determine customer behaviors in-depth. Future work would involve building a customer predictive model using machine learning algorithms to determine the likelihood of a customer buying again.
